To know that we, "The Orient" (damn, this term too), lost an entire future because of the West's imperialist project and our own “modernisation” desire, really pains me. The thought of the literature, music, food, way of life or in its totality, culture, that we could have had but is now lost to us forever will always haunt me. I know not the experience of living in a courtyard house with a main hall of symmetrically arranged stiff wooden chairs. I know only the comforts of a living room with sofas and TV, intimately arranged. I know not the pleasures of the shadows of a deep roof. I know only the aspirations for ample daylighting through skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows. I know not the datum of the kampung where one roams freely in two axes. I know only the divider of my property line which separates mine from the public. To reinstate the experiences of the past would be folly as it would be as alien to me as the introduction of the West had been for my ancestors. Worse still, it would be as hollow as the falseness it is. That distinct way of life of ours is truly gone. That culture is truly gone. This fact is truly a tragedy. 

Since the past is long dead, is there a way to save the present or to create a better present? Think of the alfresco dining of France, the street food of Malaysia and the hawker centre food of Singapore. Buildings and the city enable a particular way of life which makes architecture and urban planning instruments of culture. Orchard Road is a metonymy for shopping culture. HDB is a metonymy for the average Singaporean life. If HDB public spaces were to be better designed to invite more adults to hang out in them casually, might we have had more communal life? If transport hubs stop greedily engulfing shopping malls, libraries, community centres and increasingly more, might we experience more public life on the streets elsewhere? Architects cannot create culture but to be ignorant of the potential that architecture has to prevent the cultural tragedy that Tanizaki described is to be complicit in the murder of our way of life.
