I have been wanting to set up this corner for quite some time now but I didn't managed to get down to it because I procrastinated. As is common with many other cases of procrastination, I procrastinated out of fear. What if I put up something that I will one day look back at and feel really, really embarassed that *I* wrote that? What if what I am capable of producing is not well considered enough for this volatile social media climate? So what if I put up my writings? What can they amount to? 

On the other hand of the struggle, against the fear, are innocent desires of working towards becoming who I want to be. Someone who acts on her love of writing. Someone who contributes in her own little way to the many enlightening things she has read by offering her two cents worth back to the pool of knowledge. Someone who is courageous enough to bring herself through a journey from unknown to known. Someone who dares to dream because these little things that she does make her believe that she can do it.  

Well, I am here now. It might seem like my innocent desires have proven itself greater than my fear but the struggle is not over. In fact, I am trying to come to terms with the highly likely possibility that this struggle may never be over. So, here is a little prayer to myself, may you always prevail.
