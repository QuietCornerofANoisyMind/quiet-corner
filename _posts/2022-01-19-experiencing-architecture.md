I like reading books because some books have the ability to melt away my worries when I am reading them. The shadows of my ordinary struggles cannot exist against such light of the author making the world anew with wonder and beauty. I feel inspired by that radiance to renew my daily efforts so that one day, I too, can be a giver of such warmth with my earnest pursuits. *Experiencing Architecture* is definitely one such book. <!--more--> 

I remember many chapters from this book as if I just read it yesterday. Sometimes, I can no longer tell where my ideas end and where Rasmussenâ€™s ideas begin. They blend into a single processor through which all buildings I encounter are experienced through. Rasmussen captures the beauty of the experience of architecture so well that it is hard to not fall in love with architecture all over again when you read this book. 

This book also pulled me out of the storm I was trapped in that was formed by the 1001 architectural discourse I was exposed to. It gave me the vocabulary to describe the kind of architecture that I am interested in. It gave me a little seat in the vast architectural universe that I felt comfortable occupying. Somehow, knowing what I am gave me the ability to appreciate what others are. So, from this seat, I also learned how to see the beauty in the different ways in which architecture is important to other people. It helped tame that storm of confusion and anguish towards architecture within me. 

This is *THE* book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to fall in love with architecture. May this book offer you as much solace and beauty as it did for me.
