I felt like a macadamia nut being peeled as I read this book. At first, I was green and suspicious. Gibran’s words though beautiful was like an unrelatable piece of artwork in the museum. I don’t think I have the emotional capacity to traverse the great distances of his emotions. I felt like I could never feel what he is describing. The gap between him as a poet and me as an ordinary human was acutely felt. But the earnestness of Gibran, the persona, slowly drew me in. The great lengths that he describes how he feels made him feel like a friend whose rant I am patiently listening to. I became invested in the story even though the cynical part of me thought that this re-interpreted Romeo and Juliet tale is quite lame. At this point of the story, I was tough, crinkly and jaded. Then, in his struggles, Gibran started to ask why: Why do humans have to suffer as such? What should we do to not suffer? His probes, so masterfully phrased, voiced the same questions that I once hurled at the great nothingness of life. He had no answers. Only raw emotions of his pain and agony, only raw emotions of our collective pain and agony. I felt my wounds bleed anew. I felt so tender that it was as if I was Gibran, the persona himself. Gibran’s words have stripped me like a macadamia nut. I feel soft, tender and as white as a blank sheet. Oh, what great writers do to me. Oh, how his words make me feel. What is left of this macadamia nut other than easy consumption by life?
